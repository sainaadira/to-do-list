This to do list that is fully functional. It adds items to the lists, crosses them out when complete and clears the task list.

## How it's made:
**Tech Used** I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to build this project. Making this to-do list was a lot of fun but also very challenging as I am still new to JavaScript.

## Lesson Learned
Along with the challenges that came with building this to do list, I spent time studying JavaScript to make the functions behave accordingly. I learned a lot about how to tackle issues by reading about how loops and functions work together to make everything come together cohesively and work functionally.
